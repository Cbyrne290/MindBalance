## Testing
To ensure the site functions as intended, thorough testing was conducted across features. Navigation was verified on desktop and mobile devices, confirming smooth transitions between pages. The contact form submits data correctly (tested via browser console). Responsiveness was checked using browser dev tools, ensuring no horizontal scrolling on smaller screens.
The site was tested on Chrome, Firefox, and Safari, with consistent rendering. On various screen sizes (mobile, tablet, desktop), media queries in CSS handled layout adjustments effectively.
